# Develop two functions that are used to create 
# a special object that stores a matrix and 
# cache's its inverse

# The first function, makeCacheMatrix creates a matrix, 
# which is really a list containing a function to
# set the value of the matrix
# get the value of the matrix
# set the value of the inverse
# get the value of the inverse

             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)
}


# The second function calculates 
# the inverse of the matrix created with the above function;
# first checks to see if it has already been calculated;
# If yes, gets it from the cache and skips the computation;if no,
# calculates the inverse and sets it in the cache
